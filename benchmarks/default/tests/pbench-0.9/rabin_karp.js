var text = "Opposition groups in Bahrain as well as politicians, rights groups and many F1 fans around the world want Sundays Grand Prix  which could be watched by a global audience of more than 500 million  to be canceled while the Gulf state braces itself for more violent demonstrations after months of political unrest. \nProtesters see the race as a publicity stunt by the countrys rulers to make the nation seem more unified than it actually is. The Bahrain Grand Prix was canceled last year amid a Shiiteled uprising against the Sunni monarchy and a government crackdown in which dozens were killed and hundreds detained. \n Security concerns in Bahrain \nNabeel Rajab, an opposition protester, said the demonstrators were not against the Formula One race itself. We are just against the government or the oppressive ruling elite using that as PR, Rajab said. \nIn Britain, where many F1 teams are based, opposition leader Ed Miliband said: Sport and politics generally shouldnt mix, but ... what kind of signal does it send to the world when this grand prix is going ahead, given the concerns there are, given the violence we have seen in Bahrain, given the continuing issues around human rights? \nI dont think its the right decision to let this grand prix go ahead and I think the government needs to weigh in and express its view. \nAnd opposition politician Yvette Cooper urged British F1 stars Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton to pull out of the race. It shouldnt go ahead, I dont think British drivers should go. I think the Formula 1 should not go ahead in Bahrain, Cooper told the BBC. \nBut UK Prime Minister David Cameron refused to join the calls, insisting it was a matter for the F1 authorities whether the race went ahead. It is important that peaceful protests are allowed to go ahead, he said.\nWhy are protests now taking place in Bahrain?\nShiite opposition groups in the Sunniruled kingdom say they want equality, and have posted calls on social networking sites for daily protests during the Grand Prix weekend, to focus media attention on their demands.\nThe government has sought to ban protests in the capital Manama but that has failed to prevent violent clashes in the capital between demonstrators and authorities, who are accused of heavyhanded tactics.\nThe government has condemned violence on all sides  saying that any police officers found guilty of heavyhanded tactics would be held to account and that protesters should behave in a civil manner as well.\nAn Amnesty International report this week says promised reforms in Bahrain are inadequate and fail to provide justice for victims of human rights violations.\nProtesters are also demanding the release of jailed activist Abdulhadi alKhawaja, who has been on hunger strike for more than 70 days. AlKhawaja, 52, was arrested in April 2011 for his role in antigovernment protests that began a month earlier with demands for political reform and greater freedoms for Shiites.\nIn June, Bahrain found him and seven other Shiite opposition activists guilty of plotting to overthrow the countrys royal family.\nThe government also stands accused of punishing its own national sporting heroes and accusing them of being traitors. International and local human rights groups say three players in the Bahraini national soccer squad were arrested last year, along with more than 150 sportsmen, women and administrators. It is unclear how many remain in jail.\nThe authorities maintain they were part of illegal, violent protests.\nCould protesters disrupt the race or threaten spectators?\nThis is the big question. Protesters have vowed to protest near the Sakhir circuit, which is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) from Manama, but witnesses there say there is a heavy police presence on the road between the track and the airport.\nThe unrest makes hosting the race precarious because the racers must pass through some areas where clashes have occurred to get to the circuit, which is in the desert.\nOn Thursday protesters burned tyres, briefly blocking several main roads leading to Sakhir. A Molotov cocktail exploded late Wednesday near a car carrying members of one F1 team, Force India, during clashes between protesters and security forces. No one was reported injured in the incident.\nThe incident prompted a team member and a contractor to return home despite reassurances by officials that Bahrain is safe. Bahrain has refused to extend visas of nonsports reporting crews from CNN and other news organizations, saying they cannot stay for the race.\nWhat do F1 drivers and the sports governing body say?\nFormula Ones governing body, the FIA, decided last week the race should go ahead, after weeks of speculation. The governing body said its president traveled to Bahrain in November and met decisionmakers and opinion formers, including elected Shiite members of parliament. All expressed their wish for the Grand Prix to go ahead in 2012, it said.\nDrivers have attempted to distance themselves from the violence. Romain Grosjean of Francebased Team Lotus said his team was preparing for the event as well as we can.\nAs you say, we cant ignore the situation. But in another way, I hope the race may make a clear vision and help the situation and I think the Grand Prix will be nice, he told reporters in Bahrain.\nReigning champion Sebastian Vettel brushed off any concerns about safety, saying: I heard about the issue at Force India.\nGenerally in the paddock (staging area for the cars) it seems to be no problem, he told the Press Association. Outside of the paddock maybe there is a risk, but I think there is a risk everywhere we go.\nSeventimes title winner Michael Schumacher initially insisted he did not want to get involved before saying: I just want to say one thing which is I dont want to mix the sport with politics. Im here for the sport.\nHow much is the race worth to Bahrain and to F1 itself?\nBahrain pays $64 million to host the Grand Prix but the island kingdom it is estimated to receive several times that amount  up to $800 million  from tourism and other economic benefits.\nOf more importance is the issue of prestige that the race could bring.Opposition groups in Bahrain as well as politicians, rights groups and many F1 fans around the world want Sundays Grand Prix  which could be watched by a global audience of more than 500 million  to be canceled while the Gulf state braces itself for more violent demonstrations after months of political unrest. \nProtesters see the race as a publicity stunt by the countrys rulers to make the nation seem more unified than it actually is.
